    <p>Recent developments in AI technology have completely changed the process of scriptwriting. Writers now have the tools at their fingertips to generate new ideas, receive feedback, craft plot structures, and more - all with the help of a computer. While these tools can be harmless when used responsibly, many writers are concerned over the ramifications generative AI will have on creativity.
    <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/oct/01/hollywood-writers-strike-artificial-intelligence" target="_blank">New contracts between studios and creatives</a> allow writers to choose to use AI as a tool without limiting their financial compensation or controlling them.
    However, this is only the first step in a long process of negotiations.</p>

    <h3>ChatGPT</h3>
    <p>Developed by OpenAI, this generative artificial intelligence can aid screenwriters in the script development process. Whether it be prompting, feedback, editing, or plot and character development, the writing process is now made easier. While the software can generate full scripts on its own, plagiarism and originality ethics come into play. However, it is still an exciting way to test the limits and creative capabilities and boundaries of a machine.</p>

    <h3>Jasper AI</h3>
    <p>While mainly used for marketing and content creation, this AI helps to generate ideas based on prompts provided. Similar to other generative AI, Jasper can work as a tool, helping to outline characters and revise scripts, but it can also create its own orignial content, such as dialogue and full paragraphs to captivate audiences.</p>
